A README file in a GitHub repository serves to communicate important information about your project. It's often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. Here are some key purposes of a README file¹²:

- **Project Description**: It tells other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.
- **Expectations and Contributions**: Along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, a README communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.
- **Getting Started**: It provides instructions and examples so that users or contributors can use the project. This makes it easy for them if they encounter a problem, they will always have a place of reference.
- **Credits**: If you have worked on the project as a team, you can list your team members and include their GitHub profiles.
